# Better Queuing for NHS

A quick 2.5 hour hack for the **UCL FHIR Hackathon 2024**.

The National Health Service (NHS) faces significant challenges due to
prolonged waiting times, with patients enduring an average wait of
14.5 weeks for treatment. To address this issue, we propose an
innovative solution leveraging FHIR data and an intelligent queuing
algorithm. Our system utilises a vector database using doctor
observations of patient symptoms to efficiently prioritise patients
based on urgency. By seamlessly syncing patient data from hospital
records using the FHIR standard, our platform empowers healthcare
professionals to view and reorganise the queue according to their
expert judgement. This approach not only optimises patient
prioritisation but also alleviates the workload of doctors, nurses,
and administrators by significantly reducing the time spent organising
waiting lists. Moreover, by mitigating the emotional burden associated
with managing patient queues, our system has the potential to
positively impact patient outcomes and overall healthcare delivery
efficiency.
